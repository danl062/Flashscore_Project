READ ME**CONTEXT:**We are using the website "FLASHSCORE".Flashscore is a popular sports website that provides live score, results, and statistics for various sports including football, basketball, tennis, ice hockey, and baseball. It covers majors leagues and tournaments.For this project, we will narrow our study on the **Football Champion's League Competition**. We will only look for the teams who participated in the "Group Stage".**Prerequisites**What things you need to install the software and how to install themPython 3.7SeleniumBeautifulSoup**OUTPUT:**The aim of this project to scrap the key statistics of the 20 last games played (in all competitions) for each team of the Champion's League. We will implement this info on a separate CSV file for each team.The categories are the following:- Team 1- Competition Info- Date- Team 2- Score 1- Score 2- Bet Winner Home- Bet Draw Bet Winner Away- Expected Goals (xG) Home- Expected Goals (xG) Away- Ball Possession Home- Ball Possession Away- Goal Attempts Home- Goal Attempts Away- Shots on Goal Home- Shots on Goal Away- Shots off Goal Home- Shots off Goal Away- Blocks Shots Home- Blocks Shots Away- Free Kicks Home- Free Kicks Away- Corner Kicks Home- Corner Kicks Away- OffSide Home- Offside Away- Throw in Home- Throw in Away- GoalKeeper Saves Home- GoalKeeper Saves Away- Fouls Home- Fouls Away- Red Cards Home- Red Cards Away- Yellow Cards Home- Yellow Cards Away- Total Passes Home- Total Passes Away- Completed Passes Home- Completed Passes Away- Tackles Home- Tackles Away- Attacks Home- Attacks Away**HOW OUR CODE WORKS:**The input URL is : [https://www.flashscore.com/football/europe/champions-league/standings/#/ULMctLS6/table/overall](https://www.flashscore.com/football/europe/champions-league/standings/#/ULMctLS6/table/overall)It is a webpage with all the teams that were in the group phase of the Champions League 2022/2023.The objective is to go inside each team page previous game results.We will take Napoli as an example : [https://www.flashscore.com/team/napoli/69Dxbc61/results/](https://www.flashscore.com/team/napoli/69Dxbc61/results/)For every team, the structure is the same. The only difference is the /team/team\_name/ID code. In this case, "team/Napoli/69Dxbc61"We succeeded to find this code in the class ("tableCellParticipant\_\_image"). It is situated in the href. We then built each url for each team:[https://www.flashscore.com](https://www.flashscore.com/) + href + /results/Then, we needed to go inside each stats page for each last 20 game of the team.Still in the case of Napoli : [https://www.flashscore.com/match/lCwCe3oM/#/match-summary/match-statistics/0](https://www.flashscore.com/match/lCwCe3oM/#/match-summary/match-statistics/0)Hence, the difference between each link is in this ID code "ICwCe3oM".This is the class we used to find it:class\_=["event\_\_match event\_\_match--static event\_\_match--last event\_\_match--twoLine", "event\_\_match event\_\_match--static event\_\_match--twoLine"]And we selected only from the 5 characters since this is the part we are interested in.We have now access to the URL that interests us.We selected every stats necessary.Once all this information was obtained, we retrieved the entire table of statistics from the page for each game, adding the name of each team, the date, the score, and the bet.Here is an example of a csv file: ![](RackMultipart20230320-1-6nw3wv_html_1a198671d83233af.png)**The content of each function:**The **get\_match\_all\_games** function takes a url as an argument and returns a list of team urls. It uses the Selenium webdriver to open the url and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the page source. It then finds all the team links on the page and stores them in a list. It then writes the list to a file called team\_urls.txt.The **get\_match\_page** function takes a list of team urls as an argument and returns a list of the last 20 matches for each team. It uses the Selenium webdriver to open each team url and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the page source. It then finds all the match links on the page and stores them in a list.The **get\_match\_data** function takes a match url as an argument and returns a tuple of match data. It uses the Selenium webdriver to open the match url and then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the page source. It then finds all the match data on the page and stores it in a tuple.The **write\_to\_csv** function takes a file name and two lists of data as arguments and writes the data to the file. It first checks if the file exists and if not, it creates a header for the file. It then extracts the data from the two lists and creates a dictionary of the desired stats. It then adds the stats values to the csv line and writes the data to the file.The **main function** is the main entry point of the program. It first calls the get\_match\_all\_games function to get a list of team urls. It then reads the team\_urls.txt file and stores the urls in a list. It then calls the get\_match\_page function to get a list of the last 20 matches for each team. It then loops through the list of team urls and calls the get\_match\_data and write\_to\_csv functions for each team.
